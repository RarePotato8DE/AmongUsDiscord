channel when you are doing tasks, and unmute them in a discussion.

## Usage

Download and compile the source code or the newest release version.
At the first run the program will create a configuration file (config.json)
which you can customize to your needs.

If you just want to monitor the game, and don't use the discord integration
you also don't have to enter a bot token.

After saving your changes, restart the program and it'll work just fine!
